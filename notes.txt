0 - open air stadiums (+0 db)
1 - partially enclosed stadiums (+1.5 db)
2 - fully enclosed stadiums (+3 db)

Estimated Peak Formula
Peak db = 95 + 25 (capacity/max capacity (university of michigan) + E
E = enclosure type

goals:
create an interactive map on peak crowd noise level in big ten football stadiums (ask tim if allowed)

refined plan (as of 4/9)
- always need to refine basemap, but can come back to this
- figure out possible bivariate/rings?
- pop ups
- legend
- github




plan
- write geojson file of only bigten schools
- load geojson file into js
- create custom basemap
- convert basemap into tiles and import/integrate into script.js
- research the measured noise levels and find which ones need estimates
- figure out how to differentiate measured and estimated in adding to data (should i just hand calculate all of them)
- write function to compute estimated peak noise level using equation above
- code proportional symbols (type of symbol, by capacity or noise level or the relation between them?)
- popups of extra information on each stadium
- make a legend that explains symbol + size
- figure out github and how to share it
